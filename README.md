Call Your People!

This Android app is intended to help remind you to call the people that are important to you. After specifying your important people, along with how often you'd like to be reminded for each, the app will track your call log, and if it determines it's been too long, will send you a notification for each person.

## Buiding

I use https://sentry.io for exception logging.

## Caveats

Although CYP was written in React Native, it only runs on Android due to iOS's security limitations. I haven't attempted to get it building on iOS.
